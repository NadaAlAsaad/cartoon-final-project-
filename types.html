        deliver humor, satire, or even profound messages. With their vibrant visuals, relatable characters, and
        universal appeal, cartoons transcend language and cultural barriers, creating a shared experience that brings
        joy and meaning to audiences worldwide."</p>

            <h3>Traditional Animation</h3>
            <p>Traditional animation is the foundation of the cartoon world. Each frame is painstakingly hand-drawn,
                creating fluid motion and expressive characters. Classic cartoons like <em>Snow White and the Seven
                    Dwarfs</em> (1937) showcase the artistry of this technique, where every detail comes alive through
                the skill of animators.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cartoon-card">
            <h3>2D Digital Animation</h3>
            <p>With the rise of technology, 2D animation transitioned from hand-drawn cells to computer-based designs.
                Tools like Flash and Toon Boom have made animation faster and more accessible while preserving the
                vibrant, flat aesthetic of classic cartoons. Popular examples include <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> and
                <em>Adventure Time</em>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="cartoon-card">
            <h3>3D Animation</h3>
            <p>3D animation revolutionized the industry by introducing depth and realism. Studios like Pixar and
                DreamWorks brought unforgettable films like <em>Toy Story</em> and <em>Shrek</em> to life. By modeling
                characters and environments in three dimensions, animators create lifelike visuals that feel immersive
                and dynamic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cartoon-card">
            <h3>Stop-Motion Animation</h3>
            <p>Stop-motion animation is a labor of love, requiring animators to move physical objects frame by frame to
                create movement. Claymation, a popular form of stop-motion, has given us masterpieces like <em>Wallace
                    and Gromit</em> and <em>Coraline</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cartoon-card">
            <h3>Anime</h3>
            <p>Anime, originating from Japan, is a globally beloved animation style known for its distinctive art,
                emotional storytelling, and wide-ranging themes. From action-packed series like <em>Naruto</em> to
                heartfelt movies like <em>Spirited Away</em>, anime appeals to audiences of all ages.</p>
