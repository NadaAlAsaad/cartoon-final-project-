    <p id="p1">"Cartoons have a fascinating history that dates back to the early 20th century when the magic of
        animation was first brought to life. The journey began in 1908 with Fantasmagorie, a short animated film created
        by French artist Émile Cohl. Widely regarded as the first cartoon ever made, this hand-drawn masterpiece
        featured simple yet imaginative sketches that seemed to dance and transform before viewers' eyes. This
        innovative work marked the birth of a new art form, inspiring countless animators and setting the stage for the
        evolution of cartoons as a global phenomenon."
